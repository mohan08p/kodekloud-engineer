# Timezone Alignment

In the daily standup, it was noted that the timezone settings across the Nautilus Application Servers in the Stratos Datacenter are inconsistent with the local datacenter's timezone, currently set to Indian/Mayotte.

Synchronize the timezone settings to match the local datacenter's timezone (Indian/Mayotte).
